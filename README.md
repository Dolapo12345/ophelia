Modules

- Reaction Roles
- Server Event Calendar
- Custom VC Rooms
- Server Boost Roles

Too busy to write anything more than this so here you go

---

## Reactrole

Reactrole was designed for servers that have way too many roles to make a traditional role reaction menu to look neat. It solves this problem by creating an "Other" option that DMs all selected roles to a user so that they may choose what to assign or remove there.

#### Commands
**`&reactrole`**: Reactrole configuration menu

---

## Events

The events module was designed to facilitate community events by creating a event calendar that is accessible by members (subject to staff approval). Members can initiate their own events and subscribe to other events to receive notifications when they start.

#### Commands
`&event` List all event subcommands

---

## VC Rooms

Custom VC + Text channel pairs created by users. This isn't a new concept, but all the existing bots either have limited feature sets or really annoying messages telling you to vote or pay for their premium features.

#### Commands

- `&vc public` Make room public
- `&vc private` Make room private
- `&vc end` End call and delete room
- `&vc add` Add member or role to room (e.g. `&vc add John`)
- `&vc remove` Remove member or role from room (e.g. `&vc remove Moderator`)
- `&vc name` Rename room
- `&vc size` Set room size
- `&vc bitrate` Set room bitrate
- `&vc transfer` Transfer room ownership
- `&vc setup` Set up VC room generator
- `&vc listall` List all VC room generators
- `&vc admindel` Delete a VC room generator
- `&vc filter` Add/Remove/List VC room name filters
---

## Boostroles

For tracking and updating server boost reward roles.

#### Commands

- `&boost setup <reference role> <staff role>` Setup or reconfigure boost roles
- `&boost list` List and sync all boost roles
- `&boost sync` Same command as above
- `&boost link <booster> <role> [target]` Link a role to a user's boost status
- `&boost add <booster> <target> <colour> <name>` Add a new boost role
